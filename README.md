# house-of-cards

The aim of this kata is to model a pack of playing cards.

The cards must be able to support the following operations:

1. Sort the deck by suit (alphabetical) and face value.

2. Given a random selection of cards, group them into sets with the same face value.

3. Given a random selection of cards, sort them into runs of the same suit.

Aces are high....for now.
